### **Project Details** 
&emsp;**Name:** Implemetation and Analysis of Multi-Splay Trees 

&emsp;**Summary:** This project aims at the implementation of Multi-Splay Trees in C++ and analysing the run-time on some test cases. \
&emsp;We also analyse the amortized cost of Multi-Splay Trees theoretically and study the different properties such as Sequential Access property, \
&emsp;Static Finger property, and various other Lemmas associated with it. \
&emsp;We have used the concepts of Binary Search Trees and SplayTrees. Multi-Splay Trees are conjectured to be Dynamically Optimal.

&emsp;**Input:** The program doesn't require any user inputs.

&emsp;**Expected Output:** Build Time and Query Time for different set of test cases. 

### **Test Cases**
&emsp;Sequential Access of elements in the BST having size 30, 3000 and 300000. \
&emsp;Reverse Access of elements in the BST having size 30, 3000 and 300000. \
&emsp;Random Access of elements in the BST having size 30, 3000 and 300000.
