Project Details:
Name:
Implemetation and Analysis of Multi-Splay Trees

Summary:
This project aims at the implementation of Multi-Splay Trees in C++ and analysing the run-time on some test cases. We also analyse the amortized cost of Multi-Splay Trees theoretically and study the different properties such as Sequential Access property, Static Finger property, and various other Lemmas associated with it. We have used the concepts of Binary Search Trees and SplayTrees. Multi-Splay Trees are conjectured to be Dynamically Optimal.

Expected Output:
Build Time and Query Time for different set of test cases. 
Test Cases:
Sequential Access of elements in the BST having size 30, 3000 and 300000. 
Reverse Access of elements in the BST having size 30, 3000 and 300000.
Random Access of elements in the BST having size 30, 3000 and 300000.
